Tuesday Open Issues and notes


- Write a README -_-
X module.exports goes on the bottom of the file
- use more explicit variable names 
X make sure constructor functions are Capitalized and camelCase i.e.:
	filename: SpaceShuttle.js
	function SpaceShuttle
	module.exports = SpaceShuttle
	var SpaceShuttle = require(‘./SpaceShuttle’)
	var myShuttle = new SpaceShuttle();
- moar comments
- make an API call to get shuttle data
X shuttles should be in an array instead of shuttle1 and shuttle2
- things that are not instantiable should not be caps
- any private variables passed in as arguments to a function needn’t  be attached to “this” unless they need to be public, aka accessed by the modules that require them
X no need to use npm.js
X move your objects (aka Shuttle, Passenger, etc) into models/ directory - controllers are for route handlers
X use JSHint.org to lint all files
X add start script to package.json
X read about NPM Start
